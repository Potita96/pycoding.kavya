//You are given a positive integer N.
Your task is to print a palindromic triangle of size N.

For example, a palindromic triangle of size 5 is:

python

1
121
12321
1234321
123454321

You canâ€™t take more than two lines. The first line (a for-statement) is already written for you.
You have to complete the code using exactly one print statement.

NOTE:
Using anything related to strings will give a score of 0.
Using more than one for-statement will give a score of 0.//









CODE:
for i in range(1,int(input())+1): #More than 2 lines will result in 0 score. Do not leave a blank line also
    print((10 ** i - 1) ** 2 // 81)









Input (stdin)

Expected Output
