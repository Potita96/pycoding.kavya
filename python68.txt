//There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets, A and B, each containing m integers. You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0. For each i integer in the array, if i belongs to A, you add 1 to your happiness. If i belongs to B, you add -1 to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.

Note: Since A and B are sets, they have no repeated elements. However, the array might contain duplicate elements.

Constraints
>1 <= n <= 10^5
>1 <= m <= 10^5
>1 <= Any integer in the input <= 10^9//
