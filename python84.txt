//One of the built-in functions of Python is divmod, which takes two arguments a and b and returns a tuple containing the quotient of a/b first and then the remainder a.

For example:

>>> print divmod(177,10)
(17, 7)

Here, the integer division is 177/10 => 17 and the modulo operator is 177%10 => 7.

Task :

Read in two integers, a and b, and print three lines.
The first line is the integer division a//b (While using Python2 remember to import division from __future__).
The second line is the result of the modulo operator: a%b.
The third line prints the divmod of a and b.//






CODE:
a = int(input());
b = int(input());
print(a//b);
print(a%b);
print(divmod(a,b));






Input (stdin)
177
10
Expected Output
17
7
(17, 7)
