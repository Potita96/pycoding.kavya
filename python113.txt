//The eval() expression is a very powerful built-in function of Python. It helps in evaluating an expression. The expression can be a Python statement, or a code object.

For example:

>>> eval("9 + 5")
14
>>> x = 2
>>> eval("x + 3")
5

Here, eval() can also be used to work with Python keywords or defined functions and variables. These would normally be stored as strings.

For example:

>>> type(eval("len"))
<type 'builtin_function_or_method'>

Without eval()

>>> type("len")
<type 'str'>

Task
You are given an expression in a line. Read that line as a string variable, such as var, and print the result using eval(var).

NOTE: Python2 users, please import from __future__ import print_function.

Constraint
Input string is less than 100 characters.//










CODE:
from __future__ import print_function

var=input()
eval(var)








Input (stdin)
print(2 + 3)
Expected Output
