//Polar coordinates are an alternative way of representing Cartesian coordinates or Complex Numbers.

A complex number z
                
z=x+yj

is completely determined by its real part x and imaginary part y.
Here, j is the imaginary unit.

A polar coordinate (r, q)
is completely determined by modulus r and phase angle q.

if we convert complex number z to its polar coordinate, we find:
r : Distance from z to origin, i.e., âˆš(x^2+y^2)
q : Counter clockwise angle measured from the positive x-axis to the line segment that joins z to the origin.

Python's cmath module provides access to the mathematical functions for complex numbers.

cmath.phase
This tool returns the phase of complex number z(also known as the argument of z).
>>> phase(complex(-1.0, 0.0))
3.1415926535897931

abs
This tool returns the modulus (absolute value) of complex number z.
>>> abs(complex(-1.0, 0.0))
1.0
