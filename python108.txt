//Let's use decorators to build a name directory! You are given some information about N people. Each person has a first name, last name, age and sex. Print their names in a specific format sorted by their age in ascending order i.e. the youngest person's name should be printed first. For two people of the same age, print them in the order of their input.

For Henry Davids, the output should be:

Mr. Henry Davids

For Mary George, the output should be:

Ms. Mary George//
