//Dr. John Wesley has a spreadsheet containing a list of student's IDs, marks, class, and name.

Your task is to help Dr. Wesley calculate the average marks of the students.

Average = Sum of all marks / Total Students

Note:
1.Columns can be in any order. IDs, marks, class, and name can be written in any order in the spreadsheet.
2.Column names are ID, MARKS, CLASS, and NAME. (The spelling and case type of these names won't change.)//





CODE:
from collections import namedtuple

N = int(input())

Std_lst = []

for i in range(N+1):
    
    if i == 0:
        header = input()
        Students = namedtuple('Students',header)
    else:
        student = input().split()
        Std_lst.append(Students(student[0],student[1],student[2], student[3]))

std_sum = 0
for std in Std_lst:
    std_sum += int(std.MARKS)

print(std_sum/N)
