//We have seen that lists are mutable (they can be changed), and tuples are immutable (they cannot be changed).

Let's try to understand this with an example.
You are given an immutable string, and you want to make changes to it.

You can access an index by:
>>> print string[5]
a
Read a given string, change the character at a given index and then print the modified string.//




CODE:
def mutate_string(string, position, character):
    l = list(string)
    l[position] = character;
    string = ''.join(l);
    return string

if __name__ == '__main__':
    s = input()
    i, c = input().split()
    s_new = mutate_string(s, int(i), c)
    print(s_new)



Input (stdin)
