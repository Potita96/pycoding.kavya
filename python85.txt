//So far, we have only heard of Python's powers. Now, we will witness them!
Powers or exponents in Python can be calculated using the built-in power function. Call the power function as a^b shown below:

>>> pow(a,b) 

or

>>> a**b

It's also possible to calculate a^b mod m

>>> pow(a,b,m) 

This is very helpful in computations where you have to print the resultant % mod.

Note: Here, a and b can be floats or negatives, but, if a third argument is present, b cannot be negative.

Note: Python has a math module that has its own pow(). It takes two arguments and returns a float. It is uncommon to use math.pow().

Task :

You are given three integers: a, b, and m, respectively. Print two lines.
The first line should print the result of pow(a,b). The second line should print the result of pow(a,b,m).//








CODE:
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
m = int(input())

print(pow(a,b))

print(pow(a,b,m))
