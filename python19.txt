//You are given a set A and n other sets.
Your job is to find whether set A is a strict superset of each of the N sets.

Print True, if A is a strict superset of each of the N sets. Otherwise, print False.

A strict superset has at least one element that does not exist in its subset.//



CODE:
storage = set(input().split())

for i in range(N):

        output = False
    if len(storage2) >= len(storage):
        output = False

print(output)
