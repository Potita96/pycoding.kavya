//Let's learn some new Python concepts! You have to generate a list of the first N fibonacci numbers, 0 being the first number. Then, apply the map function and a lambda expression to cube each fibonacci number and print the list.

Concept

The map() function applies a function to every member of an iterable and returns the result. It takes two parameters: first, the function that is to be applied and secondly, the iterables.
Let's say you are given a list of names, and you have to print a list that contains the length of each name.

>> print (list(map(len, ['Tina', 'Raj', 'Tom'])))  
[4, 3, 3]  

Lambda is a single expression anonymous function often used as an inline function. In simple words, it is a function that has only one line in its body. It proves very handy in functional and GUI programming.

>> sum = lambda a, b, c: a + b + c
>> sum(1, 2, 3)

Note:

Lambda functions cannot use the return statement and can only have a single expression. Unlike def, which creates a function and assigns it a name, lambda creates a function and returns the function itself. Lambda can be used inside lists and dictionaries.//










CODE:
cube = lambda x: pow(x,3)



def fibonacci(n):
    # return a list of fibonacci numbers
    lis = [0,1]
    
    # for loop starting from 2
    for i in range(2,n):
        lis.append(lis[i-2] + lis[i-1])
    return(lis[0:n])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = int(input())
    print(list(map(cube, fibonacci(n))))
